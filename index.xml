      <description>As we learned with the box model, browsers basically represent everything in boxes, or rectangles. Fortunately, you can think of a circle as a square with really rounded corners.
We can make a square from a div by setting its height and width properties to the same value.
Then, we need to set the border-radius property, which controls the roundness of an element&amp;rsquo;s corners.
Lastly, we can use flexbox to help us center the text by setting the div&amp;rsquo;s display property to flex.</description>

      <description>Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
If you&amp;rsquo;re trying to get into tech and you belong to an under-represented group1, if you want help, I want to help. You can reach out to me via email at hello@cassie.nyc, or DM me on Twitter @cassie_moy.
You can ask me to:
 Proofread or give feedback on your resume/portfolio/LinkedIn profile Introduce you to someone I know, if we know each other Help practice behavioral interviews, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re telling the story of why you&amp;rsquo;re trying to get into tech if you&amp;rsquo;re coming from a non-traditional background Talk through bootcamps critically, or talk through what might happen next after graduating from one Be a Meetup buddy so that you&amp;rsquo;re not going to tech events alone, if you&amp;rsquo;re in NYC   1.</description>
