      <description>As we learned with the box model, browsers basically represent everything in boxes, or rectangles. Fortunately, you can think of a circle as a square with really rounded corners.
We can make a square from a div by setting its height and width properties to the same value.
Then, we need to set the border-radius property, which controls the roundness of an element&amp;rsquo;s corners.
Lastly, we can use flexbox to help us center the text by setting the div&amp;rsquo;s display property to flex.</description>
